LED light tubes for Burning Man 2019

PCB is in pcb/ and I used jlcpcb.com to print them - fast and cheap!

The tubes are like https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32678345729.html but frosted plastic like https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32977080489.html (note that this link is 12V LEDs). He custom made me some frosted 5V SK6812s.
